## Inspiration

The inspiration behind CopyCat was to inject a fun and interactive element into the coding experience, motivating users to rely less on external sources and explore their creativity with Copilot.

## What it does

CopyCat, a VSCode extension, brings a playful twist to coding. It disables external copy-paste, encouraging users to leverage Copilot for generating custom code snippets. 
It will not completely ban the copy-paste feature, user can still copy-paste their code. Meanwhile,
users are awarded credit points for their external paste behavior. For every 10 lines of code written, the user will get one credit to use for external copy-paste!

## How we built it

CopyCat was crafted using VSCode extension APIs and integrated seamlessly into the explorer panel. The cat-themed UI elements and copy-paste restrictions were implemented to enhance user engagement. 

## Challenges we ran into

It's our first time to create a VSCode extension and we are not familiar with most of the APIs. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have a well-established system with nice UIs and good control logic. 

## What we learned

Through this project, we deepened our understanding of VSCode extension development, honed our collaboration skills, and gained insights into user behavior. Learning how to balance creativity with practicality was a valuable lesson.

## What's next for CopyCat

The journey doesn't end here. We plan to refine CopyCat further, incorporating user feedback, expanding compatibility, and exploring additional features to make coding a truly enjoyable and unique experience. Stay tuned for more updates!
